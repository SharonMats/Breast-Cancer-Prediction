# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repository contains Breast Cancer Prediction project, I carried out whilst learning the Decision Trees Algorithm in Machine Learning.

Decison Trees is a type of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm, where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.  It is multifaceted and is used for solving regression and classification problems.

The Practical Steps taken :

STEP 1 - Importing the Data from csv file
STEP 2 - Visualising and cleaning the data
STEP 3 - Splitting data into 3 datasets
STEP 4 - View correlation of data 
STEP 5 - Model data into training and testing sets
STEP 6 - Prediction and Accuracy
